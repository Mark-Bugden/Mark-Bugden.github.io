## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Note: Work in progress!
This page is a place for me to store and showcase my coding projects. Information about my research, teaching experience, and contact info can be found at my personal website: [Personal Webpage](http://www.mark-bugden.com/)



### About me 

I am a research scientist with a background in mathematical and theoretical physics, where my main area of research was string theory and higher-dimensional black holes. I have recently become interested in aspects of machine learning - I am currently using Physics-Informed Neural Networks to study the behaviour of animal collectives as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.
