          <p>
            Doctor Who is a long-running television show, with a devoted fanbase
            spanning generations. Each incarnation of the Doctor has their own
            loyal following, and the fans inevitably debate which version of the
            Doctor stands out as the best. Rather than weighing in with my own
            personal opinions, I decided to take a more data-oriented approach
            to finally answer the question:
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-question">Who is the best Doctor?</div>

          <p>
            In addition to this question, we will be looking at the best and
            worst episodes, how the episodes have changed over time and which
            are the best writers and directors. In the associated notebook, we
            also took a deep-dive into what factors drive episode quality, by
            calculating how much of the variation of the ratings could be
            explained by the Doctor, as opposed to the writers and directors.
            The results were actually quite interesting , so if you are
            interested you can check them out in the

            This analysis uses IMDb user ratings for Doctor Who episodes from
            1963 to the present day.
          </p>
          <p>Each episode entry includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Year</li>
            <li>Season and episode number</li>
            <li>IMDb rating (1-10 scale)</li>
            <li>Number of votes</li>
            <li>Doctor</li>

            The dataset covers a total of
            <span class="accent-text">863 episodes</span> over
            <span class="accent-text">41 seasons</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specials, including Christmas and regeneration episodes, are
            currently not included in the analysis. Each episode is associated
            with the lead actor playing the Doctor at the time, enabling
            comparisons across different actors and eras.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data was scraped and collated from IMDb using a custom Python script
            and manually cleaned to ensure consistency across metadata fields
            such as episode names and numbering.

          <p>
            <span class="accent-text">A note on IMDb and the Gatwa era:</span>
            IMDb categorises Doctor Who seasons into three categories: the
            classical series (1963 - 1989), the modern series (2005 - 2022), and
            the Gatwa era (2023 - present). This blog post and notebook were
            written during the release window of Season 15, and therefore do not
            contain all statistics from those episodes.

            I don't think many people are really surprised to see
            <span class="accent-text">Blink</span>. at the top. It's a bit of an
            odd one - the Doctor is barely even in the episode - but it's become
            a fan favourite for a reason. It is noteworthy that David Tennant is
            the Doctor for 8 out of the 10 best-rated episodes.

          <p>
            It seems as though the Space Pirates episodes of Patrick Troughton
            were particularly disliked, but the low ratings here is more
            complicated than it might initially seem. It turns out that only
            Episode 2 exists in full - the other episodes are missing from the
            archives, which means that watching the full serial would require
            using reconstructions (tele-snaps and audio), which is likely what
            contributes to the poor ratings. All that being said, Episode 2 only
            received a rating of 5.6, so it's safe to say that people weren't
            particularly fond of the Space Pirates in any case.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's clear in the tables above that episodes from the modern series
            get more votes than episodes from the classical series. This is
            likely due to a larger and younger audience, who are more inclined
            to visit IMDb and cast votes. On average, modern-era episodes
            receive more than ten times as many votes as classical-era episodes.
            This means we can be less confident in the reliability of the
            classical ratings compared to those from the modern era.

          <p>
            IMDb ratings offer a broad measure of how audiences responded to
            each episode of <em>Doctor Who</em>. By plotting ratings against air
            dates, we can observe trends across the show's history, from the
            early black-and-white serials to the modern era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chart below shows all rated episodes from 1963 to the present.
            Each dot represents a single episode, and are coloured based on who
            the Doctor was for that episode. Additionally, the size of the dot
            is indicative of how many votes that episode received - bigger dots
            have more votes.

          <p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ratings during the classic era (1963-1989) are highly variable,
              with scattered peaks and valleys.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a noticeable increase in average ratings following the
              2005 reboot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ratings trend downward in the later seasons of the modern era,
              especially post-2017.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Plotting the average rating per year gives us a nice concise way to
            see the "big picture" trends.
          </p>

          </span>
          <p>
            We can also look at how episodes were rated across each season. The
            heatmaps below show the distribution of ratings for each episode
            within a season for both the classical and modern eras, making it
            easier to spot patterns and get more refined information about how
            each episode is rated <em>within</em> a given season.
          </p>
          <div class="heatmap-container">
            <img
              src="../images/DW/classical_ratings_heatmap.avif"
              alt="Classic Era Heatmap"
            />
          </div>
          From this heatmap we can immediately see a few notable features, such
          as the Space Pirates serial of Season 6, or the popular "Genesis of
          the Daleks" arc in Season 12. It's worth noting that in the classical
          era of Doctor Who, the episodes were structured as
          <i>serialised stories</i>. Each story was made up of shorter episodes,
          collected into a single arc of up to 12 episodes (although 4-6 was
          most common). We can see this structure clearly in the data - the
          ratings for an episode in a single story tend to be similar to the
          ratings of other episodes in that story, forming the similarly
          coloured groups in the above heatmap.
          <div class="heatmap-container">
            <img
              src="../images/DW/modern_ratings_heatmap.avif"
              alt="Modern Era Heatmap"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Unlike the classicial era, in the modern era most episodes are
            self-contained, standalone episodes with a longer format. Although
            linked episodes do exist in the modern era, they are titled
            differently and much less common.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> The Gatwa era is not included in the heatmaps due to
            the limited number of rated episodes available so far.

            Before turning to the Doctors themselves, it's worth looking at the
            people who helped shape their stories. Writers and directors have a
            huge impact on the tone, pacing, and emotional weight of each
            episode.
          </p>
          <p>
            To evaluate writers and directors, I used a
            <span class="accent-text">shrinkage-adjusted average</span>, which
            helps avoid overrating people who only worked on a handful of
            episodes. (I'll explain how this works in more detail when we get to
            the Doctors.) The top five writers and directors are shown in the
            tables below:

              Both classic and modern-era contributors appear in the top ranks,

              history.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writer-director combinations likely play a crucial role in episode
              success, with names like Moffat, Macdonald, and Talalay frequently
              associated with fan-favourite stories.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of course, even the best writing and direction needs a strong lead.
            Now that we've looked at the creative forces behind the scenes, it's
            time to turn to the face of the show itself: the Doctor.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Who is the best doctor -->
      <section id="best-doctor">
        <div class="content-block">
          <header class="major">
            <h2>Best doctor</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            We've had some hints as to which Doctor may be the best, but now
            it's time to finally settle it. To quantitatively determine which
            Doctor has the best ratings from fans, I decided to calculate
            several different metrics. The first and most obvious is the
            <span class="accent-text">naïve average</span>
            rating per Doctor across all of their episodes. Although this gives
            a idea of how positively that Doctor's episodes were rated, it
            doesn't account for vote volume or episode count. The
            <span class="accent-text">vote-weighted average</span> improves on
            this by giving more influence to episodes with more IMDb votes.
            Instead of treating each episode equally, it reflects how viewers
            collectively rated a Doctor's run - factoring in which episodes had
            the most engagement. However, even vote-weighted ratings can be
            skewed if a Doctor appeared in only a few episodes. To address this,
            we compute a
            <span class="accent-text">shrinkage-adjusted average</span>, which
            regularizes the vote-weighted average based on how many episodes
            each Doctor appeared in, pulling averages for small-sample examples
            closer to the global average. (We used this to calculate which were
            the best writers and directors in the previous section.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, these three metrics provide a fairer and more robust way
            to compare how each Doctor's episodes were received. That said, as
            we'll see, the differences between them are relatively small -
            suggesting a reassuring consistency across the various approaches.
            The chart below shows how each Doctor scored across all three
            metrics. While the rankings are close, a clear frontrunner does
            emerge.
          </p>

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #777">
              David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor — consistently a fan favourite.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Across all three rating metrics, Tennant consistently comes out on
            top, combining high ratings, strong audience engagement, and a
            substantial number of episodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            So there it is - the data has spoken. David Tennant takes the crown.
            Of course, stats don't tell the whole story - but they are very
            useful the next time you are at a house party and you need to prove
            to someone why David Tennant is the best Doctor.
