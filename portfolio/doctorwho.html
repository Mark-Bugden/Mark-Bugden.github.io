      <h2>1. Opening Hook: The Timeless Question</h2>
      <p>Every Doctor has their defenders. Tennant’s charm? Iconic. Capaldi’s gravitas? Undeniable. Tom Baker’s scarf? Practically a co-star. But beyond personal favorites, what if we turned to the data to help answer one of fandom’s oldest debates: <strong>Who is the best Doctor?</strong></p>
      <p>In this post, we take a data science approach to a question often ruled by emotion and nostalgia. By collecting and analysing IMDb ratings from over 800 episodes across six decades, we can build a more objective view of what resonates with audiences. This isn’t just about averages—we dive into vote-weighted scores, statistical shrinkage to correct for sample sizes, and variance decomposition to see whether it’s the actor, the writer, or the director that matters most. The first step? Creating a structured, clean dataset that allows us to isolate the factors driving episode ratings.</p>

      <h2>2. A Show of Highs and Lows</h2>
      <p>Building a dataset that spans over 60 years of British television is not for the faint of heart. The show has changed formats, cast, and even production conventions over the years, which makes merging historical data tricky. By stitching together IMDb's raw episode lists, ratings, and crew data—and sprinkling in some manual sanity checks—we assembled a structured dataset that links every episode to its season, release year, Doctor, writer(s), and director(s). It’s not quite Gallifreyan technology, but it’s clean enough to analyse.</p>
      <p>Doctor Who’s greatest strength might be its range. It’s a show that can pivot from tragedy to absurdity, from horror to historical drama. But with that boldness comes variation in quality. Some episodes are etched into pop culture memory; others are politely ignored. We begin by zooming in on the extremes: the most, and least, beloved episodes, according to IMDb users.</p>
